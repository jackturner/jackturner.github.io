				<div class="event">Born a stupid baby with no grasp of the English language in White Plains, NY <time datetime="1981-08-01T19:00">on August 1, 1981.</time></div>

				<div class="event">Built my <a href="https://brickset.com/sets/8034-1/Universal-Set" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first Lego Technic set</a>. Parents called me to dinner and I just kept building. <time datetime="1989-10-01T19:00">1989.</time></div>

				<div class="event">Got my first Mac, a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_LC_II">Performa 405</a>, in 6th grade. Changed everything. My grades went up. I got taller. Possibly unrelated. <time datetime="1992-08-25T09:00">Christmas 1992.</time></div>

				<div class="event">Mom signed me up for a community college course in Photoshop. I was the only kid in the class. Got an A. <time datetime="1996-08-04T00:00">Summer of 1996.</time></div>

				<div class="event">First job. My mom would drop me off at people‚Äôs houses and I‚Äôd teach them how to work their computer or fix something. At 15 I was starting to see the appeal of freelance. <time datetime="1996-09-23T00:00">September, 1996.</time></div>

				<div class="event">First web job. I did grunt work for the talented folks at Digital Instincts. I got to work on an ancient version of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001018025617/http://www.alecbaldwin.com/">Alec Baldwin‚Äôs website</a>. No lie. <time datetime="1999-06-01T19:00">Summer of 1999.</time></div>

				<div class="event">Designed, developed, and released a Mac app for doing video performance called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="grid.jpg">GRID</a>. I was still an undergrad, but I built an app that made tens of thousands of dollars. I thought I was pretty great. <time datetime="2003-08-12T00:00">August, 2003.</time></div>

				<div class="event">Some friends of mine and I <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://vimeo.com/191366424">performed at Lincoln Center</a>. Two of us remixed video footage of me falling down a hill while two of us provided a live score for the result. <time datetime="2004-07-15T21:00">July 15th, 2004.</time></div>

				<div class="event">After getting version two of GRID out the door, I assembled my first PC and built <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060105073800/http://www.vidvox.net/grid2.php">GRID2 for Windows</a>. This is VIDVOX‚Äôs only Windows app to date. Mine too, I think. <time datetime="2005-02-14T20:17">February, 2005.</time></div>

				<div class="event">My friends at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://id29.com">ID29</a> designed this cool single page site for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://oliviaartz.com/jackadam/infusystem/">Infusystem</a> that I built in only a week. <time datetime="2010-04-12T00:00">April, 12 2010.</time></div>

				<div class="event">A friend and I were approached by a non-profit to design and build <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://vimeo.com/93756181">Quest For College</a>, an HTML/CSS/JS adaptation of a board game designed to prepare high school kids for the college application process. It‚Äôs crazy that anything this slick ever ran in IE6. <time datetime="2010-04-23T00:00">April 23, 2010.</time></div>

				<div class="event">When Agora Games needed some help getting a completely redesigned <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110202114444/http://www.majorleaguegaming.com/">MLGPro.com</a> out the door they called on me and my friend Adam. I was in the process of reading the HTML5 spec for fun, so it was a great oportunity to flex this new standard at scale. <time datetime="2010-08-26T00:00">August of 2010.</time></div>

				<div class="event">Artist Fernando Orellana wanted a unique website that showed off his images as big as possible. I built him a new <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://fernandoorellana.com">WordPress powered site</a> that goes to unique lengths to fill as much of the browser window with his work as possible. He paid me with a painting that makes me happy every single day. <time datetime="2010-09-09T00:00">September of 2010.</time></div>

				<div class="event"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://alloveralbany.com/archive/2011/09/09/tiny-face">Tiny Face</a> was a really silly thing that Adam Grossman and I did to experiment with iOS development. It used <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120628034143/http://blog.jackadam.net/2011/how-small-can-you-make-your-stupid-face/" target="blank">advanced computer vision techniques</a> to answer a question no one ever asked: How tiny can you make your face? <em>We made less than $150 charging a buck for it, so we made it free because we‚Äôre awesome.</em> <time datetime="2011-09-25T19:00">September of 2011.</time></div>

				<!-- <div class="event">My friend and business partner, Adam Grossman, had an idea for a weather <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jackadam/dark-sky-hyperlocal-weather-prediction-and-visuali">Dark Sky Kickstarter Launched</a> <time datetime="2011-10-26T00:00">October 26, 2011</time></div> -->

				<div class="event">When my friend <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/davidlublin">David</a> needed a redesign of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://vidvox.net">VIDVOX website</a> I was happy to be of service. All of the illustrations on the site were done by the immensely talented <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/bureaunorth">Bryan Kahrs</a>. <time datetime="2012-01-04T00:00">January 4, 2012.</time></div>

				<div class="event"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://nanospace.molecularium.com">Nanospace</a> is an online amusement park built in close collaboration with the biotech department at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

				<div class="event">John Gruber called Dark Sky an ‚Äúinnovative, gorgeous, and highly practical weather app for iPhone and iPad.‚Äù On <time datetime="2012-04-17T00:00">April 17, 2012</time> we released the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jackadam/dark-sky-hyperlocal-weather-prediction-and-visuali">Kickstarter funded</a> project. It continues to be one of the most popular weather apps in the App Store.</div>

				<div class="event">I was one of two developers that built the front-end interface for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://blog.darksky.net/announcing-forecast/">Forecast</a>, a website that provided free local weather forecast information to anyone. We were immensely proud of the mobile web interface you could save to the homescreen of your iPhone. <time datetime="2013-03-25T00:00">March 25, 2013.</time></div>

				<!-- <div class="event">Moved to Massachusetts <time datetime="2013-08-31T19:00">August 31, 2013</time></div> -->

				<div class="event">I started noticing that certain times on the clock read as 2 raised to a specific power. For instance, 2:56, 5:12, and 10:24 are 2<sup>8</sup>, 2<sup>9</sup>, and 2<sup>10</sup> respectively. So I built <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://oliviaartz.com/binary-clock/">binary clock</a> to aid with this sillyness. <time datetime="2015-06-07T19:25">June 7, 2015.</time></div>

				<div class="event">Artist <a href="http://fernandoorellana.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fernando Orellana</a> wanted a one-page site that would allow people to submit protest ideas for his installation ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll Never Know We Were Here‚Äù. I designed and built him this <a href="http://robotprotest.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robot Protest</a> site that uses a Google Spreadsheet as the database and moderation system. <time datetime="2018-01-01T19:25">January, 2018.</time></div>
